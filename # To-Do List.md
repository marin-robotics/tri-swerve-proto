# To-Do List
Necessary:
- Change strafing angles
- Test shooter code
- Test that positive yaw vector rotates clockwise

Would be nice:
- Think about how Tasks and while loops work with delay
- Add combined strafing options in manual, make both absolute and relative strafing
- Change proportional angle motor adjuster to a full PID

Theoretical Notes:
- Change rotate_to_field_angle to have proportional velocity
