# To-Do List
Necessary:
- Change strafing angles, allow diagonals, decide on orientation stuff
- Add field oriented for both color alliances by flipping coordinates and fixing auton selector
- Add shooter code!!!!!
- Test/create auton functions and make routes

Test/fix:
- Test gps updating
- Think about how Tasks and while loops work with delay for auton routes

Would be nice:
- Change proportional angle motor adjuster to a full PID
- Change rotate_to_field_angle to have proportional velocity
